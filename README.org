This is a demonstration of using nix to build Latex with minimal dependencies.
Locally, you should be able to run src_bash{nix build} and =result/sample.pdf= will be the results of building =src/sample.tex=.
If you'd like to speed up this build, src_bash{cachix use latex-sample} should avoid rebuilding the custom texpkgs.
